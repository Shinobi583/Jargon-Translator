# Jargon-Translator

The Jargon Translator is meant to help lessen the confusion and increase understanding when reading Documentation, Articles, or anything related to a specific field.

Anyone studying in a specific field or just wanting to learn something new will often get confused and slow down, or just give up entirely thanks to all that Jargon thrown around. Let the Jargon Translator help you out!

The <em>initial</em> idea is to have key-value pairs that would swap out any word or phrase with another word or phrase in simple human terms. Something we ALL can understand no matter our background. The new word/phrase would be highlighted so the user knows some Jargon was replaced. The user could click on the replacement and see what the Jargon was. Or just turn off the Translator.

The Test Page is for testing functionality first and then will move on to a browser extension.

If you would like to submit a translation for a field of study and cannot find your field, please start it up in the Jargon folder!

Some Examples with a lot of Jargon are:<br/>
-Business<br/>
-Computer Science<br/>
-Biology<br/>
-Medical<br/>
etc.

Let's work together to make things easier to understand and to learn!
