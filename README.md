# Jargon-Translator

The Jargon Translator is meant to help lessen the confusion and increase understanding when reading Documentation, Articles, or anything related to a specific field.

The <em>initial</em> idea is to have key-value pairs that would swap out any word or phrase with another word or phrase in simple human terms. The new word/phrase would be highlighted so the user knows some Jargon was replaced. The user could click on the replacement and see what the Jargon was.

If you would like to submit a translation for a field of study and cannot find your field, please start it up in the Jargon folder!

Some Examples with a lot of Jargon are:<br/>
-Business<br/>
-Computer Science<br/>
-Biology<br/>
-Medical<br/>
etc.

Let's work together to make things easier to understand and to learn!
