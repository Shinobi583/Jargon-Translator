# Jargon-Translator

The Jargon Translator is meant to help lessen the confusion and increase understanding when reading Documentation, Articles, or anything related to Computer Science.

The <em>initial</em> idea is to have key-value pairs that would swap out any word or phrase with another word or phrase in simple human terms. The new word/phrase would be highlighted so the user knows some Jargon was replaced.

Let's work together to make things easier to understand and to learn!
