# Jargon-Translator

The Jargon Translator is meant to help lessen the confusion and increase understanding when reading Documentation, Articles, or anything related to a specific field.

Replace confusing terms with a translation in your own words! For now, to create a new field of study, just copy one of the existing <em>field</em>.js files
and then switch out some of the info! Including the function names.

Let's work together to make things easier to understand and to learn!
